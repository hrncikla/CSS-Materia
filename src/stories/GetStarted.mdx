# Get Started with My Materia

Materia is a modern CSS/SCSS framework inspired by Material Design 3.  
Here’s a quick guide to start using it in your project.

---

## 1. Installation options

You can use My Materia in three ways depending on your setup:

### a) Include raw CSS (quickest)

Simply copy the built CSS into your project and include it in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/materia.min.css" />
```

### b) Use SCSS (recommended for customization)

Clone or copy the `materia/` folder into your project structure:

```bash
src/
 ├── scss/
 │    ├── materia/
 │    │    ├── tokens/
 │    │    ├── mixins/
 │    │    ├── layout/
 │    │    ├── components/
 │    │    └── base/
 │    └── main.scss
```

Then import it in your main SCSS file:

```scss
@use "materia/base";
@use "materia/tokens" as tokens;
@use "materia/components/button";
```

You can override tokens or mixins before importing components.

### c) Integrate with Storybook + JavaScript (for interactive components)

If you're using Storybook to document or prototype, you can:

1. Include the SCSS entry point in `.storybook/preview.js` (or via Vite/webpack config).
2. Add JavaScript enhancements (like ripple effects or floating labels) by importing:

```js
import { initMateria } from "../js/materia.js";
initMateria();
```

You can also document your components with Materia styling directly inside your MDX stories.

## 2. Customize tokens

To adapt Materia to your brand, edit files in `materia/tokens/`.  
These include colors, typography, radius, spacing, etc.

Example:

```scss
$md-sys-color-primary: #7e57c2;
$md-sys-shape-corner-medium: 12px;
```
