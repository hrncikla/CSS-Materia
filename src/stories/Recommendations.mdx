# Recommendations

Here are some best practices and suggestions for working with My Materia framework.

---

## 1. Use SCSS for full flexibility
While you can use precompiled CSS, SCSS gives you access to:
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Customizable mixins
- Per-component configuration

We recommend setting up SCSS with `@use` and defining your own override tokens before importing components.

---

## 2. Structure your SCSS by features
Keep your styles modular. Example structure:

```bash
scss/
 ├── tokens/        # Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
 ├── mixins/        # Reusable SCSS mixins (e.g. palette, typography)
 ├── layout/        # Flex/grid utilities and spacing helpers
 ├── components/    # Styles for buttons, cards, inputs, etc.
 └── base/          # Reset, global element styles, and typography
```

---

## 3. Stick to Material Design 3 guidelines
My Materia follows MD3 principles.
For consistency, refer to [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) when making design decisions.

---

## 4. Use design tokens consistently
Avoid hardcoding values like `#ccc` or `12px`.
Instead, use system tokens:
```scss
color: var(--md-sys-color-outline);
padding: var(--md-sys-spacing-medium);
```

---

## 5. Document your design decisions
If you're building on top of Materia, keep track of your:
- Token overrides
- Custom mixins or layout rules
- Accessibility decisions

This helps future devs (or your future self) understand and reuse your setup.

---

## 6. Don't override components directly
Prefer to:
- Adjust via tokens
- Extend using your own wrapper classes
- Avoid editing base component files directly

This makes upgrades and refactoring much easier.
